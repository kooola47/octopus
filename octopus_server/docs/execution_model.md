## üèÅ Overview

The Execution Model manages all task execution records in the Octopus system. It tracks when tasks are executed, by which clients, the results of those executions, and performance metrics.

### Key Responsibilities
- Execution record creation and management
- Execution status tracking
- Result collection and storage
- Performance metric collection
- Execution history maintenance

- `dbhelper.py` - Database operations
- `routes/modern_routes.py` - Execution-related API endpoints
- `constants.py` - Execution status constants

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The executions table stores all execution-related information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS executions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    execution_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    task_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    client TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
    result TEXT DEFAULT '',
    created_at REAL,
    updated_at REAL
)
```

### Fields Description

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER (Primary Key) | Internal execution record ID |
| execution_id | TEXT (Unique) | Unique execution identifier |
| task_id | TEXT | Reference to the task being executed |
| client | TEXT | Client that executed the task |
| status | TEXT | Execution status (pending, running, completed, failed) |
| result | TEXT | Execution result data |
| created_at | REAL | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | REAL | Last update timestamp |

### Indexes

- `idx_executions_execution_id` - For execution ID lookups
- `idx_executions_task_id` - For task-based queries
- `idx_executions_client` - For client-based queries
- `idx_executions_status` - For status-based queries
- `idx_executions_created_at` - For time-based queries
- `idx_executions_updated_at` - For update time queries

## üîÅ Execution Lifecycle

Execution records follow a defined lifecycle:

### States
1. **Pending** - Execution record created, awaiting start
2. **Running** - Execution in progress
3. **Completed** - Execution finished successfully
4. **Failed** - Execution encountered an error

### State Transitions
```
Pending ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Completed/Failed
```

### Lifecycle Management
- State transitions are triggered by client reports
- The system validates state changes
- Timestamps are automatically updated

---

## üì° Execution Tracking

The system tracks executions across all clients:

### Tracking Mechanism
- Each task execution creates a new execution record
- Clients report execution status updates
- Server aggregates execution data for reporting

### Unique Identifiers
- Each execution has a unique `execution_id`
- Format: `{task_id}_{client}_{timestamp}`
- Ensures uniqueness across all executions

### Real-time Updates
- Clients send execution status updates
- Server processes and stores updates
- Dashboard displays real-time execution status

---

## üì¶ Result Management

Execution results are stored and managed:

### Result Storage
- Results stored as text in the `result` field
- Can contain structured data (JSON) or plain text
- Size limitations based on database constraints

### Result Processing
- Results are processed when received from clients
- Structured results are parsed for dashboard display
- Error results are flagged for special handling

### Result Retention
- Results are retained for historical tracking
- Cleanup policies can be applied (not yet implemented)
- Results can be exported for analysis

---

## üìä Performance Metrics

The execution model collects performance data:

### Collected Metrics
- Execution start time
- Execution end time
- Duration calculation
- Client information
- Task information

### Metric Usage
- Dashboard displays execution statistics
- Performance reports generated from metrics
- System optimization based on performance data

### Timing Accuracy
- Timestamps recorded at key execution points
- Client-side and server-side timestamps
- Time synchronization considerations (future enhancement)
