.SYNOPSIS
    Octopus Client Setup and Launch Script
.DESCRIPTION
    This script sets up the conda environment, installs dependencies, and starts the Octopus client.
    It handles both fresh installations and updates to existing environments.
.PARAMETER SkipEnvSetup
    Skip conda environment setup (useful if environment already exists)
.PARAMETER ServerUrl
    URL of the Octopus server (default: http://localhost:8000)
.PARAMETER ClientName
    Custom name for this client (default: auto-generated)
.EXAMPLE
    .\setup_client.ps1
    .\setup_client.ps1 -SkipEnvSetup
    .\setup_client.ps1 -ServerUrl "http://192.168.1.100:8000"
    .\setup_client.ps1 -ClientName "WorkstationClient"
